Welcome to Super Mario Cards! Have you ever played Super Mario Bros 3 on the NES console? If you did, you might remember there was a card game in the mushroom houses, where you had to find as many symbol pairs as possible and received the items as a prize. Well, I wanted to build something for fun and so I recreated my own version of that Super Mario Bros 3 mini game as a tribute to all the fun childhood memories.

Have fun playing!
